			<h2>Atom and Molecules</h2>

			<div class="content">
			<p>Ancient Indian and Greek philosophers have always wondered about the unknown and the unseen form of matter.Divisibility of matter was first founded in India around 500 BC.An Indian philosopher Magarishi Kanad,said tht if we go on dividing mattermwe shall get smaller and smaller particles.</p><br>

			<p>Around the same era ,ancient Greek philosphers-Democritus and Leucippus suggested that if  we go on dividing matter,a stage will come when the particles obtained cannot be divided further.Democritus called these indivisible particles atoms.By the end of the eighteenth century,scientists recognizedd the difference  between elements and compounds  and naturally became interested in finding out how and why these elements combine and what happens  when they combine.</p><br>


			<p>Antoine L.Lavoisier laid the foundation of chemical laws sciences by establishing two important laws of chemical combination.Law of conservation of mass states that mass can neither be destroyed or be created ina chemical reaction.</p><br>


			<h3>LAW OF CONSTANT PROPORTIONS</h3>

			<p>Lavoisier,along with other scientists told that many compounds were composed of two or more elements and each such compoud had the same elements in the same sizes,irrespective of where the compound came from or who prepared it.</p><br>

			<p>In a compound such as water,the ratio of the mass of hydrogen to the mass of oxygen is always 1:8,whatever the source of water.Similiarly in ammonia,nitrogen nad hydrogen are always present in the ratio 14:3 by mass,whatever the method or the source from which  it is obtained.This led to the law of constant proportions  which is also known as the law of definite proportions.This law was coined by Proust as <i>"In a chemical substance the elemnts are always present in definite proportions by mass."</i></p><br>

			<p>British chemist John Dalton provided the basic theory about the nature of matter.Dalton picked up the idea of divisibility of matter,which was till then just a philosophy.He took the name 'atoms' as given by the Greeks and said tha the smallest particles of matter are atoms.His theory was based  on the laws of chemical combination.Dalton's atomic theory provided an explanation for the law of conservationof mass and the law of definite proportions.</p><br>

			<p>According to Dalton's atomic theory,all matter ,whether an element ,a compound  or a mixture is composed of small particles called atoms.The postulates of this theory may be stated as follows:
				<ol>
					<li>All matter is made of very tiny particles called atoms.</li>
					<li>Atoms are indivisible particles,which cannot be created or destroyed  in a chemical reaction.</li>
					<li>Atoms of a given element are identical in mass and chemical properties.</li>
					<li>Atoms of different elements  has different masses and chemical properties.</li>
					<li>Atoms combine in the ratio of  small whole numbers to form compounds.</li>
					<li>The relative number and kinds  of atoms are constant in a given compound.</li>
				</ol>
			</p><br>


			<h3>WHAT IS AN ATOM?</h3>
			<p>Atoms are very small,they are smaller than anything that we can imagine or compare with.More than millions of atoms when stacked would make a layer barely as thick as this sheet of paper.Our entire world is made of atoms.We may not be able to see them,byut they existand constantly affect what we do.Through modern techniques,we can now produce magnifoed images of surfaces of elements showing atoms.</p><br>


			<h3>WHAT ARE THE MODERN DAY SYMBOLS OF ATOMS OF DIFFERENT ELEMENTS?</h3>
			<p>Dalton was the first scientist to use thesymbols for elemnts ina very specific sense.When he used a symbol for an element he also meant a definitive quantity of that element.Berzilius suggested that the symbols of elements bemade from one or two letters of the name of the element.</p><br>

			<p>In the beggining ,the names of the elements were derived from the name of the place where they were found for the first time.IUPAC(International Union of Pure and 	Applied Chemistry)approves  names of elemnts.Many of the symbols are the first one or two letters of the elements name in English.Symbols of some elements are formed  from the first letter of the name and a letter,appearing later in the name.Other symbols have been taken from the  names of elements in Latin,German or Greek</p><br>

			<h3>ATOMIC MASS</h3>
			<p>The most remarkable concept that Dalton's atomic theory proposed was that  of the atomic mass.According to him,each elemnt had a characteristic  atomic mass.The theorycould  explain the aw of constant proportions so well that scientists were promoted to measure  the atomic mass of an atom.Since determining the mass of an individual atom wad a relatively difficult task,relative atomic  mass were determined using the laws  of chemical combinations and the compounds formed.</p><br>


			<h3>HOW DO ATOMS EXIST?</h3>
			<p>Atoms of most elements are not able to exist independently,Atoms form molecules and ions.These molecules or ions aggretate in large numbers to form the matter that we can see,feel or touch.</p><br>



			<h3>WHAT IS A MOLECULE?</h3>
			<p>A molecule is in general a group of two or more atoms that are chemically bonded together,that is,tightly held together by attractive forces.A molecule can be defined as the smallest particle of an element  or a compound that is capable of an independent existence and shows all the properties of that substance.Atoms of the same element or of different elements can join to form molecules.</p><br>

			<h3>MOLECULES OF ELEMENTS</h3>
			<p>The molecukes of an elemnt are constituted  by the smame type  of atoms.Molecules of many elements are made up of  only one atom of that elemntBut this is not the case with most of the non-metals.Metals and some other elements,such as carbon,do not have a simple structure but consist of a very large and indefinite number of atoms bonded together.</p><br>


			<h3>WHAT IS AN ION?</h3>
			<p>Compounds composed of metals and non-metals  contain charged species.The  charged species are known as ions.An ion is a charged particle and can be negatively or positively charged.A negatively charged ion is called an 'anion' and  the positively charged ion is called a 'cation'.</p><br>
